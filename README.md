This datapack is used to change resources of totems while using [muffintime-resource-pack](https://github.com/RealMuffinTime/muffintime-resource-pack).  
For Minecraft version `1.21.2-1.21.3`.

## Features

It's is possible to change Totem textures via the command `/function muffintime:<totem_type>`.  
Currently `<totem_type>` can be one of:
   | Custom item texture for totem    | custom_model_data | `<totem_type>`    |
   | -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
   | UNO Reverse Card Green           | 0                 | green             |
   | UNO Reverse Card Blue            | 1                 | blue              |
   | UNO Reverse Card Red             | 2                 | red               |
   | UNO Reverse Card Yellow          | 3                 | yellow            |
   | Animated UNO Reverse Card Ahegao | 69                | ahegao            |

The totem needs to be hold in mainhand, while running the command.

It is recommended to install a permission system, because the `/funtion` command is by default only available to server operators.
