# The MuffinTime Datapack

This datapack is used to change resources of totems while using [muffintime-resource-pack](https://github.com/RealMuffinTime/muffintime-resource-pack). For Minecraft version `1.21–1.21.1`.

It's is possible to change Totem textures via the command `/function muffintime:<totem_type>`.  
Currently `<totem_type>` can be one of:
 * ahegao
 * blue
 * green
 * red
 * yellow

The totem needs either be dropped on the floor near you or to be hold in mainhand, while running the command.

It is recommended to install a permission system, because the `/funtion` command is by default only available to server operators.
